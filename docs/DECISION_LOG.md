## ADR 1: Onboarding Credential Enforcement (Forced Password Reset)

### Problem
When employees are bulk-imported via Excel (Zimyo Engine) or created manually by an Administrator, they are assigned a default system-wide temporary password (`DEFAULT_EMPLOYEE_PASSWORD`). Leaving these temporary credentials active without renewal exposes the personnel profile and bank data to immediate security compromise.

### Context
Laravel Breeze provides complete authentication scaffolding but contains no built-in mechanism to intercept active sessions, block standard dashboard routes, or force password renewals. We need a centralized, maintainable control point that:
1. Intercepts all web requests.
2. Checks user status flags.
3. Restricts page interactions without bloating individual controllers.
4. Bypasses the blocks for the password change request inputs and the logout triggers to prevent infinite redirection loops.

### Alternatives Considered
* **Option A: Controller-level Checks:** Inject a helper check into every controller action.
  * *Trade-off:* High maintenance overhead; extremely prone to dev oversight during future feature integrations.
* **Option B: Route Grouping Scopes:** Split all active routes into two groups: "Verified Reset" and "Unverified Reset".
  * *Trade-off:* Complex route organization, complicates clean REST resources, and leads to messy route definitions.
* **Option C: HTTP Middleware Interceptor (Chosen):** Create a single custom middleware class registered in the application container's main web middleware pipeline.

### Chosen Solution
Implement the `CheckPasswordChange` route middleware, registered globally on the `web` pipeline in [app.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/bootstrap/app.php). The middleware queries the `must_change_password` boolean attribute on the authenticated user model. If true, and the current route is not `password.change`, `password.change.update`, or `logout`, it redirects the user to `/password/change`.

### Consequences
* **Positive:** Complete global coverage. Any new controllers or routes integrated in the future are automatically protected without extra code.
* **Negative:** If developers write external API routes or endpoints under the web group, they will get redirected unless explicitly whitelisted in the middleware route-name checks.

  * [PasswordController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/PasswordController.php) (routes handler)
  * [app.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/bootstrap/app.php) (middleware registrar)
* **Related Release:** Phase D (`v1.0-phase-d` completion commit `14a6f80`)

## ADR 2: Sequential Alphanumeric Employee ID Auto-Generation

### Problem
Exposing internal auto-increment database primary keys (`users.id`) directly in views, URLs, or export files exposes business metrics (employee volume) and creates insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities. We need a standardized corporate identifier that is unique, sequential, and formatted for corporate accounting.

### Context
Manual keying of employee codes leads to duplicates, formatting inconsistencies (e.g., mixing `EMP-1`, `emp_01`, and `EMP00001`), and data import mapping failures. The system must automatically suggest a formatted ID on user creation while validating uniqueness.

### Alternatives Considered
* **Option A: UUIDs:** Use random 36-character identifiers (e.g. `d3b07384d113...`).
  * *Trade-off:* High security, but impossible for HR and payroll staff to communicate verbally or print on ID badges.
* **Option B: Manual Input Only:** Force administrators to type unique codes.
  * *Trade-off:* High risk of duplicate key exceptions and typing fatigue.
* **Option C: Sequential suger prefix mapping (Chosen):** suggestion of alphanumeric codes starting at `EMP00001`, incrementing based on the highest existing code in the database.

### Chosen Solution
Create a helper method `generateEmployeeId()` inside [EmployeeController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php) that queries the maximum existing `employee_id` in the database, extracts the numeric suffix, increments it, and formats the output with a left zero pad of size 5, pre-pended with the `EMP` token.

### Consequences
* **Positive:** Consistent formatting (`EMP00001` to `EMP99999`), zero manual overhead for administrators, easy alignment with Zimyo imports.
* **Negative:** Relies on retrieving the highest ID which could create a race condition if two admins click create at the exact same millisecond. Since the database unique index on `employee_id` is active, it throws a query exception rather than saving duplicates, making it safe.
* **Related Files:**
  * [EmployeeController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php) (suggestion and creation handler)
* **Related Release:** Phase C.1 (`v1.0-phase-c.1` completion commit `e37dd81`)

## ADR 3: Model-Level Encryption Casts for Sensitive Identification & Financial Columns

### Problem
Storing government identifiers (Aadhaar, PAN) and banking coordinates in plain text exposes employees to identify theft and places the company in legal violation of privacy regulations.

### Context
We must ensure that even if the raw database is leaked or accessed by direct database admins, sensitive credentials remain unreadable without the encryption key. However, the application code should easily query, read, and display these records in forms when authenticated HR staff requests them.

### Alternatives Considered
* **Option A: Database-level TDE (Transparent Data Encryption):** Use MySQL native encryption functions.
  * *Trade-off:* Database vendor lock-in; complicates migration between engines (e.g. SQLite for testing vs MySQL for prod).
* **Option B: Manual Crypt Facades in Controllers:** Explicitly invoke `Crypt::encrypt()` and `Crypt::decrypt()` on every controller save and read.
  * *Trade-off:* Highly repetitive, verbose code; high risk of developer error.
* **Option C: Eloquent Model Casts (Chosen):** Map target columns to the `encrypted` cast type in the model configuration array.

### Chosen Solution
Declare target columns (`aadhar_card`, `pan`, `account_no`, `ifsc_code`) in the `$casts` property array of [EmployeeProfile.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/EmployeeProfile.php) with the type `encrypted`.

### Consequences
* **Positive:** Automatic transparent handling. The database stores ciphertext strings (AES-256), but the application reads plain text naturally. SQLite local tests run seamlessly using the same casts.
* **Negative:** Encrypted fields cannot be searched using standard SQL `WHERE ... LIKE` queries. Sorting on these fields is also impossible. Since these are private IDs, searching and sorting on them is not a business requirement.
* **Related Files:**
  * [EmployeeProfile.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/EmployeeProfile.php) (implements casts)
* **Related Release:** Phase 4 (`v1.1-phase-4` completion commit `3369d64`)

## ADR 4: Alphanumeric String Schemas for Experience Fields

### Problem
In initial schema drafts, experience metrics (e.g. total previous experience, years completed) were mapped as numeric decimal fields. When importing Zimyo export spreadsheets, parsing text duration descriptions like `"3 Years 6 Months"` or `"4.5"` caused database query exceptions during database insertion.

### Context
Excel sheets exported from Zimyo and similar third-party services contain organic, non-standardized string representations of experience metrics. Forcing numeric conversion in the import script led to data truncation (e.g. loss of months) or import crashes.

### Alternatives Considered
* **Option A: Excel Text Parsers:** Write complex regex functions to convert `"3 Years 6 Months"` to float `3.5`.
  * *Trade-off:* Excel sheets contain many unpredictable string variations, causing continuous parsing failures and high code complexity.
* **Option B: Database Schema Migration to Strings (Chosen):** Change columns to nullable strings.

### Chosen Solution
Create database migration `2026_06_19_084725_change_experience_columns_to_strings_in_employee_profiles.php` that alters the `previous_year_experience`, `years_completed`, and `overall_year_experience` columns in `employee_profiles` table to `string` format.

### Consequences
* **Positive:** Safe uploader operations, zero import crashes due to experience formats, and direct preservation of original Zimyo sheet terminology.
* **Negative:** Sorting or math operations on experience duration cannot be run at the database layer (must be parsed in memory if needed).
* **Related Files:**
  * `database/migrations/2026_06_19_084725_change_experience_columns_to_strings_in_employee_profiles.php` (schema refactor)
* **Related Release:** Phase 4.3 (`v1.1-phase-4.3` completion commit `ea088c8`)

## ADR 5: Configurable Historical Shift Rules Transition Strategy (09:00 vs 09:30 Shift Start)

### Problem
When shift start rules change (e.g., from 09:00 AM start to 09:30 AM start), applying the new rule retroactively to historical logs will alter existing clock-in records, falsely changing employee attendance histories (e.g. changing past status from `late` to `present`). We must maintain the integrity of historical logs while enforcing the new rule going forward.

### Context
Laravel databases store clock-in times as raw timestamps. If the application dynamically calculates "late minutes" on the fly using a single static configuration value, historical reports will fluctuate whenever the config changes. We need a way to support rules transitions at a specific point in time.

### Alternatives Considered
* **Option A: Write late minutes into the database:** Save `late_minutes` as a static column on the `attendances` table at the moment of clock-in.
  * *Trade-off:* High redundancy; database fields can go out of sync if cleanups/corrections are applied, and does not support retroactive fixes if the grace duration itself needs correcting.
* **Option B: Date-threshold config mapping (Chosen):** Define a `new_rules_start_date` parameter in `config/attendance.php` and dynamically evaluate the date of the record.

### Chosen Solution
In the `Attendance` model, retrieve the `attendance.new_rules_start_date` configuration. If the record's `date` is greater than or equal to this threshold date, calculate delay minutes relative to the new 09:30 shift start time. If it is prior to the threshold, fallback to the old 09:00 shift start baseline.

### Consequences
* **Positive:** Complete protection of historical payroll and compliance records. Changes to future shift hours do not corrupt historical data.
* **Negative:** Requires mapping the configuration parameter `new_rules_start_date` in the `.env` file of all environments. If it is omitted, the model defaults to the historical fallback rules (09:00 AM start) to ensure safety.

  * [attendance.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/config/attendance.php) (configuration settings)
* **Related Release:** Phase 4.5 (`v1.1-phase-4.5` completion commit `b599f5a`)

## ADR 6: Simplified Nullable Leave Requests (Leave Type Nullability)

### Problem
In early iterations, standard employees had to classify their own leave requests (Casual Leave, Sick Leave, Earned Leave) when applying. However, employees frequently selected types for which they had insufficient balance, or misclassified standard LOP leaves. This resulted in significant HR correction overhead and manual rollbacks.

### Context
We want standard employees to only be responsible for specifying *when* they need time off and *why*, while leaving classification decisions (Paid vs Unpaid LOP) to the managers and administrators during review.

### Alternatives Considered
* **Option A: Client-side Balance Checks:** Validate balances dynamically in Javascript on the employee form.
  * *Trade-off:* Does not prevent users from choosing types they are not eligible for (e.g. sick leaves vs casual leaves classification criteria are determined by company policies, not just balance count).
* **Option B: Leave Nullability & Manager Classification (Chosen):** Make `leave_type` nullable, remove dropdowns for standard employees, and enforce type assignment at approval.

### Chosen Solution
Create database migration `2026_06_23_184204_make_leave_type_nullable_in_leave_requests_table.php` which alters the `leave_requests.leave_type` column to nullable. Remove dropdown select inputs from employee Blade forms. In `LeaveRequestController.php`, require managers to specify `leave_type = 'paid_leave'` or `'unpaid_leave'` during approval.

### Consequences
* **Positive:** Drastically reduced HR management overhead, eliminates invalid employee self-bookings, and ensures every paid leave is explicitly reviewed and verified by a manager.
* **Negative:** Admins applying for leave themselves still require type definitions on creation (handled via standard auto-approval pathways in `LeaveRequestController@store`).
* **Related Files:**
  * `database/migrations/2026_06_23_184204_make_leave_type_nullable_in_leave_requests_table.php` (schema migration)
  * [LeaveRequestController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/LeaveRequestController.php) (actions updates)
  * `resources/views/leaves/create.blade.php` (Blade template form inputs)
* **Related Release:** Phase 4.6 (`v1.2-phase-4.6` completion commit `2385dbb`)
