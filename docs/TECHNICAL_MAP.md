## 2. Core Business Subsystems

---

### Module 1: Authentication, Onboarding & RBAC

#### A. Business Purpose & Architecture Lineage
* **Purpose:** Secures personnel files and restricted actions by regulating session authentication, enforcing strong password conventions, forcing onboarding updates for temporary passwords, and partitioning permissions across roles (`admin`, `manager`, `employee`).
* **Lineage:** 
  * *Phase B:* Standard Laravel Breeze layouts setup.
  * *Phase C.1:* Added basic user role columns.
  * *Phase D:* Added reporting parent keys (`manager_id`, `admin_id`) and `must_change_password` column.
  * *Phase E:* Created `CheckPasswordChange` interceptor middleware.
  * *Current State:* Public self-registration is disabled. Admins reset passwords to default, which re-arms forced onboard redirections.

#### B. Codebase Mappings
* **Controllers:**
  * [AuthenticatedSessionController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php) (login / logout)
  * [PasswordController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/PasswordController.php) (force-reset onboarding password save)
  * [PasswordResetLinkController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/PasswordResetLinkController.php) (forgot-password link creation)
  * [NewPasswordController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/NewPasswordController.php) (recovery link verification)
* **Middleware & Policies:**
  * [CheckPasswordChange.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Middleware/CheckPasswordChange.php) (forces updates)
  * [EnsureUserIsAdmin.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Middleware/EnsureUserIsAdmin.php) (restricts route access)
* **Routes:**
  * `login` / `logout` (declared in [auth.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/routes/auth.php))
  * `password.change` / `password.change.update` (onboarding redirects)
  * `admin.employees.reset-password` (forces reset)
* **Views:**
  * `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`
  * `resources/views/auth/change-password.blade.php`

#### C. Database Schema
* **Table:** `users` (Tracks login credentials, role assignments, and onboarding indicators)
  * `id` (`bigint unsigned`, PK): Unique row identifier.
  * `name` (`varchar(255)`): Full employee name.
  * `email` (`varchar(255)`, UK): Unique email address.
  * `password` (`varchar(255)`): BCRYPT-hashed credentials.
  * `role` (`enum('admin','manager','employee')`, Default: `'employee'`): Permissions group.
  * `must_change_password` (`tinyint(1)`, Default: `1`): Onboarding force flag.

#### D. Verification Suite
* **Test File:** [PasswordStrategySecurityTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/PasswordStrategySecurityTest.php)
  * *Scenarios:*
    1. Creation fails if default provisioning credentials are unset in `.env`.
    2. Admin can reset any employee password to default.
    3. Resetting password re-arms onboarding change-password intercepts.
* **Test File:** [AuthenticationTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/Auth/AuthenticationTest.php)
  * *Scenarios:*
    1. Users can authenticate with valid credentials.
    2. Invalid passwords fail authentication.

* **Lineage:**
  * *Phase C.1:* Department and Employee CRUD list directories.
  * *Phase D:* Self-referencing manager hierarchies. Manager indexes restricted to direct reports.
  * *Phase 4.7.3:* Standardized table vertical cell padding (`py-3.5 px-5`), aligned monospaced ID headers, and added hover row indicators.

#### B. Codebase Mappings
* **Controllers:**
  * [DepartmentController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/DepartmentController.php) (CRUD for departments)

  * `department_id` (`bigint unsigned`, FK -> `departments.id`, Nullable, ON DELETE SET NULL).
  * `manager_id` (`bigint unsigned`, FK -> `users.id`, Nullable, ON DELETE SET NULL).

#### D. Verification Suite
* **Test File:** [HierarchySplitTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/HierarchySplitTest.php)
  * *Scenarios:*
    1. Users can only view employees in their own department (if scoped).
