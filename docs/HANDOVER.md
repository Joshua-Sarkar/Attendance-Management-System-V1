# AMS-V1 — Handover Document

This document serves as the primary entry point for developers, maintainers, auditors, and AI assistants onboarding onto the Attendance Management System Version 1 (AMS-V1) project.

---

## 1. Project Overview

* **Project Name:** AMS-V1 (Attendance Management System Version 1)
* **Purpose:** A centralized, web-based platform to govern workforce profiles, daily check-in logs, and leave requests.
* **Business Goals:**
  1. Own workforce personal and banking databases securely by encrypting sensitive records.
  2. Implement strict punctuality logic (shift start times, buffer grace periods, late delays).
  3. Manage leave balance accounts using a double-entry ledger database pattern.
  4. Streamline initial data imports from external exports (Zimyo platform compatibility).
* **Current Production Status:** Live in production on Hostinger Linux Shared Server. Codebase has all tests passing and is synchronized under git control.

## 4. Active Modules

### 1. Authentication & RBAC
* **Purpose:** Authenticates users and isolates menus and record views based on roles (`admin`, `manager`, `employee`). Forces password changes on onboarding.
* **Current Status:** Operational. Public self-registration is disabled.
* **Primary Files:**
  * [CheckPasswordChange.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Middleware/CheckPasswordChange.php) (middleware)
  * [AuthenticatedSessionController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php) (session controller)
  * [PasswordController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/PasswordController.php) (password change and provisioning updates)

### 2. Workforce Management
* **Purpose:** Manages department structures and creates, edits, or deletes employee listings.
* **Current Status:** Operational. Auto-generates unique Employee IDs. Index directories are fully aligned with Phase 4.7.3 contrast and vertical padding standards.
* **Primary Files:**
  * [EmployeeController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php)
  * [DepartmentController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/DepartmentController.php)

### 3. Employee Profiles
* **Purpose:** Stores personal details, emergency contacts, addresses, previous employment, and encrypted financial/government IDs (Aadhaar, PAN, Bank details).
* **Current Status:** Operational. Encrypts sensitive fields automatically at rest using model casts.
* **Primary Files:**
  * [EmployeeProfile.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/EmployeeProfile.php) (includes casts array)
  * Views folders under `resources/views/employees/`

### 4. Attendance Tracking
* **Purpose:** Logs employee check-in and check-out logs and calculates delay minutes relative to the grace threshold.
* **Current Status:** Operational. Late arrivals are processed dynamically using model properties.
* **Primary Files:**
  * [Attendance.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/Attendance.php) (includes late minutes logic)
  * [AttendanceService.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Services/AttendanceService.php) (check-in/out logic)

### 5. Attendance Audit Center
* **Purpose:** A centralized interface for Admins to search logs, view check-in timelines, analyze exceptions, and update statuses.
* **Current Status:** Operational.
* **Primary Files:**
  * [AttendanceAuditController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/AttendanceAuditController.php)
  * `resources/views/admin/attendance-logs.blade.php`

### 6. Leave Management
* **Purpose:** Allows employees to submit leave requests. Handles approval workflows and cancels.
* **Current Status:** Operational. Leaves are submitted without type parameters; Paid/Unpaid classification is resolved at the approval stage.
* **Primary Files:**
  * [LeaveRequestController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/LeaveRequestController.php)
  * [LeaveRequest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/LeaveRequest.php)

### 7. Leave Balance Ledger

* **Current Status:** Operational. Uses database pessimistic locks to prevent race conditions during updates.
* **Primary Files:**
  * [LeaveLedgerEntry.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/LeaveLedgerEntry.php) (ledger table model)
  * [LeaveBalanceService.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Services/LeaveBalanceService.php)

### 8. Employee Import Engine
* **Purpose:** Parses Zimyo Excel exports, registers missing departments, maps hierarchies in two passes, and initializes opening balances.
* **Current Status:** Operational. Renders import metrics, log listings, and warnings in style compliance with Phase 4.7.3.
* **Primary Files:**
  * [EmployeeImportService.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Services/EmployeeImportService.php)
  * [ImportController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/ImportController.php)

### 9. Profile Correction Requests

* **Current Status:** Operational. Renders request log tables using high-contrast text and desaturated tag styles.
* **Primary Files:**

### 10. Scheduled Commands
* **Purpose:** Console commands for backing up data and managing leave balance credits.

## 6. Current Database Summary

AMS-V1 uses 9 primary tables. Relationships are managed at the database level using foreign keys:

* `users`
* `departments` (each employee belongs to a department)
* `attendances` (each record represents a user check-in per day)
* `leave_requests` (linked to `users` with an option for approval details)
* `leave_request_logs` (logs request status changes)
* `employee_profiles` (1:1 extension mapping of the `users` table)
* `import_logs` (logs bulk user import details)
* `profile_correction_requests` (records employee edit requests)
* `leave_ledger_entries` (audit logs tracking leave balance modifications)

## 12. AI Continuation Prompt

To continue development in a new chat session, copy and paste this prompt:

```text
Please read the handover document at docs/HANDOVER.md to understand the current project state, layout paths, and development goals.

Then, review these files in order:
1. docs/CURRENT_STATE.md (to confirm active version snapshot and metadata)
2. docs/TECHNICAL_MAP.md (to locate codebase modules and database tables)
3. docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (to review deployment setup scripts)

Treat the project documentation inside `/docs` as the source of truth for the codebase.

The current target task is to initiate Phase 5 — Payroll Integration. Review the handover roadmap and wait for further instructions.
```
