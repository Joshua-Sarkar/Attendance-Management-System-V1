## 1. Project Phase Mapping

The table below maps the development timeline, indicating completion commits, intermediate commits, recommended release tags, and notes.

| Chronological Order | Phase | Completion Commit | Intermediate Commits | Recommended Tag Name | Description & Release Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Phase C.1** | `e37dd81` | `2cd6e03`, `a43098a`, `ab6f4bc` | `v1.0-phase-c.1` | **Employee & Department CRUD:** Implemented database seeds, migrations, controller structures, validation schemas, status flags, and lists for department directories and staff records. |
| 2 | **Phase B** | `e6a324e` | None | `v1.0-phase-b` | **Stitch Sidebar Redesign:** Integrated modern sticky left navigation panel containing role-based menu options. |
| 3 | **Phase C** | `9ddd786` | None | `v1.0-phase-c` | **Attendance Tracking Foundation:** Added check-in/out endpoints, late delay calculation logic (shift start 09:00 with 15m grace), and personal logs. |
| 4 | **Phase D** | `14a6f80` | None | `v1.0-phase-d` | **Hierarchy & Workforce Management:** Added `manager_id` self-referential user keys and restricted user logs access so managers only see assigned staff. |
| 5 | **Phase E** | `125e72e` | None | `v1.0-phase-e` | **Leave Requests & Rule B Override:** Built leave request status chains, manager approval paths, and Rule B logic where approved leaves override absent flags. *(Note: Tag `v1.0-phase-e` and `v1.0-production-ready` already exist in repository).* |
| 6 | **Phase 4.1** | `d88009b` | None | `v1.1-phase-4.1` | **Zimyo Migration Engine:** Created a bulk Excel file upload parsing engine utilizing `PhpSpreadsheet`, executing in two passes to link managers, write encrypted personal records, and generate logs. *(Note: Originally committed as "Phase 2").* |
| 7 | **Phase 4** | `3369d64` | `8e8b593` | `v1.1-phase-4` | **Profiles & Encrypted Fields:** Created the secondary profiles table, added tabbed forms, and implemented model-level encryption casts for Aadhaar, PAN, and Bank columns. |
| 8 | **Phase 4.3** | `ea088c8` | None | `v1.1-phase-4.3` | **Experience Column Corrections:** Refactored profile table fields (overall experience, years completed) from float fields to string formats to allow textual data imports. |
| 9 | **Phase 4.2** | `05df1a8` | None | `v1.1-phase-4.2` | **Correction Requests & Hardening:** Built the employee correction queue, admin control panel, and database transactions for profile updates. |
| 10 | **Phase 4.4** | `82fd54a` | None | `v1.1-phase-4.4` | **Punctuality Audit Center:** Built a search-filtered attendance list grid showing check-in timelines and average late arrival metrics, complete with dark-gold theme. |
| 11 | **Phase 4.5** | `b599f5a` | None | `v1.1-phase-4.5` | **Leave Balance Ledger & Concurrency:** Created transactional double-entry ledger audits, console accrual tools, and pessimistic row locking (`lockForUpdate`). |
| 12 | **Phase 4.6** | `2385dbb` | `3d517c9`, `918ad86` (Patch) | `v1.2-phase-4.6` | **Leave Workflow Simplification:** Made `leave_type` nullable on create. Removed dropdowns for employees and moved Paid/Unpaid selection to approval. Added sidebar badge counters. *(Note: Tag `v1.2-phase-4.6` already exists in repository).* |
| 13 | **Phase 4.7** | `Current Commit` | None | `v1.2-docs-baseline` | **Architecture Traceability & Consolidation:** Conducted retrospective architecture audit, verified and created all missing historical tags, established Feature/Database/Test maps and ADR Decision Logs. |
