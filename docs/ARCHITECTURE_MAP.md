# AMS-V1 — System Architecture Map

This document describes the high-level subsystem relationships, data flow boundaries, and operational dependencies of the Attendance Management System Version 1 (AMS-V1).

## 1. Subsystem Interaction Model

The diagram below shows how the 9 major subsystems interact with each other and route their respective data dependencies:

## 2. Subsystem Relationships & Data Flows

### Authentication & Security Relationships
* **Authentication → Workforce Management & Dashboards:** 
  * The `CheckPasswordChange` middleware intercepts all incoming requests to workforce and dashboard routes.
  * If the authenticated user has `must_change_password = true`, they are blocked and redirected to the password change view.
* **Authentication → Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  * Controllers map user roles (`admin`, `manager`, `employee`) to restrict query boundaries.
  * Route middleware (`EnsureUserIsAdmin`) restricts import routes, correction queues, and audit dashboards to admin staff.

---

### Department & Workforce Management Relationships
* **Workforce Management → Employee Profiles:**
  * When a new User is created under the workforce management controllers, a corresponding 1:1 mapped `employee_profiles` record is automatically initialized by the service layer.
* **Workforce Management → Attendance:**
  * Daily check-in lists and late audits use the department filters (`department_id`) and name search inputs from users to display roster attendance.
* **Workforce Management → Leave Management:**
  * When a standard employee applies for a leave request, the system checks their `manager_id` reporting chain to route approval actions to their direct supervisor.

---

### Employee Profiles Relationships
* **Employee Profiles → Authentication & Security:**
  * Sensitive data attributes mapped in [EmployeeProfile](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/EmployeeProfile.php) use the Laravel encrypter configuration from the core config keys, ensuring decryption fails if the `APP_KEY` environment value changes.
* **Employee Profiles → Zimyo Import Engine:**
  * The Zimyo import parser directly instantiates and populates [EmployeeProfile](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/EmployeeProfile.php) rows during Pass 1, writing personal and bank data.
* **Employee Profiles → Profile Correction Requests:**
  * When an employee submits a correction request, it points to a specific field in their [EmployeeProfile](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/EmployeeProfile.php) table (e.g. `bank_name` or `pan`). When resolved by an Admin, the profile record is updated directly.
