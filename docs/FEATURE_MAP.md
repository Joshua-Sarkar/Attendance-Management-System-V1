# AMS-V1 — Feature & Subsystem Traceability Map

This document decomposes the Attendance Management System Version 1 (AMS-V1) into independently traceable architectural domains, mapping features and business requirements directly to the codebase components.

---

## 1. Authentication, Onboarding & RBAC

### Business Purpose
To secure personnel records and operations by regulating application access based on verified identities, enforcing secure password rules, forcing immediate password updates for newly provisioned or reset accounts, and partitioning functional permissions across three clear roles (`admin`, `manager`, `employee`).

### Architecture Lineage
* **Original Business Problem:** The organization lacked centralized access logs. Personnel details and emergency/financial records were shared over unsecured channels or Excel sheets, exposing private data to unauthorized staff.
* **Phase Introduced:** Initial Laravel setup (Breeze base) in Phase B / database foundation.
* **Major Evolutions:**
  * *Phase C.1 / Database Foundation:* Created basic role columns in database table `users`.
  * *Phase D:* Added self-referencing hierarchy keys (`manager_id`, `admin_id`) to the `users` table to restrict manager queries. Added the `must_change_password` boolean attribute.
  * *Phase E:* Built the `CheckPasswordChange` middleware interceptor, redirecting unprovisioned users to standard change-password forms.
* **Current Implementation:** A hybrid of Laravel Breeze's default cookie-session authentication combined with the custom `CheckPasswordChange` middleware. Administrators can reset an employee's password to default, which automatically re-arms the forced update flag.

### Codebase Mappings
* **Controllers:**
  * [AuthenticatedSessionController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php) (login / logout)
  * [PasswordController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/PasswordController.php) (interactive force-reset onboarding controls)
  * [PasswordResetLinkController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/PasswordResetLinkController.php) (forgot-password workflow)
  * [NewPasswordController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/NewPasswordController.php) (password recovery link validation)
* **Models:**
  * [User.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/User.php) (contains `role` and `must_change_password` attributes)
* **Services / Middleware:**
  * [CheckPasswordChange.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Middleware/CheckPasswordChange.php) (forces password update before letting users reach dashboards)
  * [EnsureUserIsAdmin.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Middleware/EnsureUserIsAdmin.php) (protects administrative routes)
* **Routes:**
  * `login` / `logout` (declared in [auth.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/routes/auth.php))
  * `password.change` (view for onboarding updates)
  * `password.change.update` (saves new onboarding password and disables force-reset flag)
  * `admin.employees.reset-password` (forces reset back to default)
* **Views:**
  * `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`
  * `resources/views/auth/change-password.blade.php`
* **Migrations:**
  * `0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php` (sets up basic users table)
  * `2026_06_10_104616_add_provisioning_columns_to_users_table.php` (adds `must_change_password` and onboarding flags)
  * `2026_06_11_134500_add_admin_id_to_users_table.php` (adds administrative audit tracking key)
* **Feature Tests:**
  * [AuthenticationTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/Auth/AuthenticationTest.php) (tests user logins)
  * [PasswordStrategySecurityTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/PasswordStrategySecurityTest.php) (asserts password updates and forced redirection flows)
* **Release Introduced:** `v1.0-phase-d`
* **Current Operational Status:** Fully operational. Self-registration is disabled (commented out in `routes/auth.php`) to keep directory control strictly in administrative hands.

---

## 2. Department & Workforce Management

### Business Purpose
To partition the workforce into distinct business units (departments), manage primary employee user accounts, configure reporting chains (managers and administrators), and prevent security violations by isolating records based on active roles.

### Architecture Lineage
* **Original Business Problem:** The organization lacked structured department boundaries. General staff lists were fully visible to all registered accounts, and managers could view and manage personnel records outside their teams.
* **Phase Introduced:** Phase C.1 (CRUD directory) and Phase D (manager hierarchy scope).
* **Major Evolutions:**
  * *Phase C.1 (Commit `e37dd81`):* Developed the basic CRUD routes, controllers, and views for managing department models and staff records. Created default seed tables.
  * *Phase D (Commit `14a6f80`):* Integrated self-referential reporting chains using `manager_id` on the `users` table. Modified queries in `EmployeeController.php` index action so that Managers can only view employees where `manager_id = auth()->id()`.
* **Current Implementation:** Managers and Administrators can perform CRUD operations on employees, but Managers are restricted to employees reporting directly to them and cannot create Admin or Manager roles. Employee IDs are auto-generated sequentially under the format `EMP` + 5 digits (e.g. `EMP00001`).

### Codebase Mappings
* **Controllers:**
  * [DepartmentController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/DepartmentController.php) (CRUD for departments)
  * [EmployeeController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php) (CRUD for workforce users, validation limits)
* **Models:**
  * [Department.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/Department.php)
  * [User.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/User.php) (contains primary employee fields: status, role, manager_id, department_id)
* **Services:**
  * [EmployeeService.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Services/EmployeeService.php) (delegates database updates)
* **Routes:**
  * `departments` resources (standard Laravel endpoints)
  * `employees` resource routes
* **Views:**
  * `resources/views/departments/index.blade.php`, `create.blade.php`, `edit.blade.php`
  * `resources/views/employees/index.blade.php`, `create.blade.php`, `edit.blade.php`, `show.blade.php`
* **Migrations:**
  * `2026_06_09_142514_create_departments_table.php`
  * `2026_06_09_141744_modify_users_table_for_ams.php` (role, status, employee_id keys)
* **Feature Tests:**
  * [HierarchySplitTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/HierarchySplitTest.php) (checks department boundaries, active workforce metrics, role-based visibility, and blocks managers from creating admin profiles)
* **Release Introduced:** `v1.0-phase-c.1` (CRUD baseline) and `v1.0-phase-d` (hierarchy controls)
* **Current Operational Status:** Fully operational. Sequential employee ID auto-generation is managed inside `EmployeeController@generateEmployeeId`. Circular manager assignments are blocked during validation.

## 3. Employee Profiles

### Business Purpose
To store extended employee metadata (addresses, education, bank accounts, emergency contacts, previous jobs) securely and automatically encrypt sensitive government identifiers and banking fields at rest using AES-256 encryption.

### Architecture Lineage
* **Original Business Problem:** Sensitive identity identifiers (Aadhaar numbers, PAN, bank account numbers, IFSC codes) were stored in plain text, violating data protection protocols. Additionally, importing experience fields (e.g. "5 Years 2 Months") failed because database tables defined experience duration as numeric float fields.
* **Phase Introduced:** Phase 4 (Profiles and Encrypted Fields) and Phase 4.3 (Experience format corrections).
* **Major Evolutions:**
  * *Phase 4 (Commit `3369d64`):* Created `employee_profiles` table to isolate non-authentication attributes in a 1:1 mapped relationship to `users`. Integrated multi-tab views and enabled model-level encryption casts.
  * *Phase 4.3 (Commit `ea088c8`):* Altered the experience columns (`previous_year_experience`, `years_completed`, `overall_year_experience`) from decimal fields to nullable strings to allow importing of textual metrics (e.g., "5.5 Years" or text logs).
* **Current Implementation:** Profile data is entered across organized form tabs (Personal, Contact, Address, Bank, Education, Experience). When saving, standard Eloquent model encryption casts automatically encrypt sensitive columns in SQLite/MySQL.

### Codebase Mappings
* **Controllers:**
  * [EmployeeController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php) (saves profile tabs data)
  * [ProfileController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php) (updates basic user settings)
* **Models:**
  * [EmployeeProfile.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/EmployeeProfile.php) (implements database encryption casts)
* **Routes:**
  * `employees.edit` / `employees.update`
  * `profile.edit` / `profile.update`
* **Views:**
  * `resources/views/employees/create.blade.php`, `edit.blade.php`, `show.blade.php` (organized tabs layout)
* **Migrations:**
  * `2026_06_18_093324_create_employee_profiles_table.php` (creates profiles table)
  * `2026_06_19_084725_change_experience_columns_to_strings_in_employee_profiles.php` (experience fields type change)
* **Feature Tests:**
  * [EmployeeProfileTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/EmployeeProfileTest.php) (verifies 1:1 bidirectional relations, cascade deletion on user delete, and database encryption casts validation)
  * [EmployeeProfileAccessTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/EmployeeProfileAccessTest.php) (verifies access boundary rules for profiles)
* **Release Introduced:** `v1.1-phase-4` (Profiles) and `v1.1-phase-4.3` (Experience fixes)
* **Current Operational Status:** Fully operational. Aadhaar, PAN, Bank Account Number, and IFSC Code are encrypted automatically. Alphanumeric experience values import successfully.

## 4. Attendance Tracking & Auditing

### Business Purpose
To log employee daily check-in and check-out timestamps, evaluate check-in delays against configurable start times and grace periods, bypass Sunday weekend runs, integrate active leave request status overrides, and present HR with a queryable punctuality audit center.

### Architecture Lineage
* **Original Business Problem:** Inaccurate manual spreadsheets, lacks grace calculations, absent flags assigned to employees who were actually on authorized leave, and no unified view of late arrivals.
* **Phase Introduced:** Phase C (Foundation), Phase E (Leave overrides), Phase 4.4 (Audit Center), and Phase 4.5 (Shift rules transition).
* **Major Evolutions:**
  * *Phase C (Commit `9ddd786`):* Created `attendances` schema, added check-in/out actions, set default shift time to 09:00 AM with 15-minute grace, and generated employee personal logs.
  * *Phase E (Commit `125e72e`):* Integrated Rule B: if an employee is absent but has an approved leave request, their daily status resolves to `on_leave` or `wfh`. If they physically check in, the physical record overrides the leave.
  * *Phase 4.4 (Commit `82fd54a`):* Built the HR Punctuality Audit Center with search, status, department, and date filters, listing late exceptions and calculating delay averages.
  * *Phase 4.5 (Commit `b599f5a`):* Shift configurations updated to transition start times from 09:00 AM to 09:30 AM (retaining 15-minute grace) using `new_rules_start_date` flag to safeguard older records.
* **Current Implementation:** Daily check-ins are logged in `AttendanceService.php`. The `Attendance` model dynamically calculates late arrival minutes using a custom attribute accessor that evaluates the date against `new_rules_start_date` to decide which grace threshold applies.

### Codebase Mappings
* **Controllers:**
  * [AttendanceController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/AttendanceController.php) (clock buttons, dashboard queries)
  * [ManagerAttendanceController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/ManagerAttendanceController.php) (roster views)
  * [AttendanceAuditController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/AttendanceAuditController.php) (HR console log filters)
* **Models:**
  * [Attendance.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/Attendance.php) (late minutes attribute)
* **Services:**
  * [AttendanceService.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Services/AttendanceService.php) (computes statuses, average delays, and exceptions lists)
* **Routes:**
  * `attendance.check-in` / `attendance.check-out`
  * `admin.attendance.logs` (Punctuality Audit panel)
* **Views:**
  * `resources/views/attendance/employee-dashboard.blade.php`
  * `resources/views/admin/attendance-logs.blade.php`
* **Migrations:**
  * `2026_06_10_000000_create_attendances_table.php` (sets up unique index on `[user_id, date]` to prevent concurrent double check-ins)
* **Feature Tests:**
  * [AttendanceVerificationTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/AttendanceVerificationTest.php) (clock inputs)
  * [AttendanceMetricsTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/AttendanceMetricsTest.php) (delay thresholds math)
  * [AttendanceAuditTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/AttendanceAuditTest.php) (global filter queries)
  * [WorkingDaysTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/WorkingDaysTest.php) (Sunday exclusions)
* **Release Introduced:** `v1.0-phase-c` (Foundation) and `v1.1-phase-4.4` (Audit Center)
* **Current Operational Status:** Fully operational. Saturday is processed as a standard workday; Sunday is marked as `weekend` and skipped from absent aggregations.

## 5. Leave Request Management

### Business Purpose
To allow employees to submit leave applications, route requests to designated supervisors, enable managers to review and classify leaves during approval, handle employee self-cancellations, and permit administrators to override past decisions.

### Architecture Lineage
* **Original Business Problem:** Leaves were managed via emails and verbal agreements. Staff had to classify their own leaves (Casual, Sick, LOP), which led to incorrect ledger entries and verification bottlenecks.
* **Phase Introduced:** Phase E (Foundation) and Phase 4.6 (nullable simplified leave types).
* **Major Evolutions:**
  * *Phase E (Commit `125e72e`):* Built core `leave_requests` and `leave_request_logs` tables. Added status transitions (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `cancelled`). Allowed employees to choose leave types on submission.
  * *Phase 4.6 (Commit `2385dbb`):* Simplified workflow by making the `leave_type` database column nullable. Removed dropdowns for standard employees, moving Paid/Unpaid classification strictly to the manager's approval action. Admin self-submissions remain auto-approved but require choosing paid/unpaid on create.
* **Current Implementation:** Employees submit requests containing only dates and reasons. Managers review pending rows and select either **Approve as Paid** or **Approve as Unpaid**, or reject. The request log table audits all status changes.

### Codebase Mappings
* **Controllers:**
  * [LeaveRequestController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/LeaveRequestController.php) (submits requests, checks balance limits, applies approvals, rejects, cancels, and admin overrides)
* **Models:**
  * [LeaveRequest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/LeaveRequest.php) (defines dates and total days)
  * [LeaveRequestLog.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/LeaveRequestLog.php) (stores request actions audit trail)
* **Routes:**
  * `leaves.index` (list logs)
  * `leaves.create` / `leaves.store` (blank apply form)
  * `leaves.approve` / `leaves.reject` / `leaves.cancel` / `leaves.override`
* **Views:**
  * `resources/views/leaves/index.blade.php`, `create.blade.php`, `show.blade.php`
* **Migrations:**
  * `2026_06_11_153000_create_leave_requests_table.php`
  * `2026_06_11_153500_create_leave_request_logs_table.php` (tracks user details and status changes)
  * `2026_06_23_184204_make_leave_type_nullable_in_leave_requests_table.php` (nullable change)
* **Feature Tests:**
  * [LeaveManagementTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/LeaveManagementTest.php) (asserts request submissions, manager approval boundaries, overlapping date checks, self-cancellation routes, and admin self-approvals)
* **Release Introduced:** `v1.0-phase-e` (Foundation) and `v1.2-phase-4.6` (Simplified Nullable Leave)
* **Current Operational Status:** Fully operational. Active overlaps are validated and blocked during submission to prevent duplicate bookings.

## 6. Leave Accrual & Balance Ledger

### Business Purpose
To manage employee leave balance accounts under a transaction audit model, utilize database concurrency locks to prevent race conditions during rapid reviews, and credit monthly balances using automated console tasks.

### Architecture Lineage
* **Original Business Problem:** User leave balances were updated directly without change logs. Double-clicking approval buttons rapidly caused database race conditions, resulting in duplicate deductions and negative balances.
* **Phase Introduced:** Phase 4.5 (Leave Balance Ledger & Concurrency).
* **Major Evolutions:**
  * *Phase 4.5 (Commit `b599f5a`):* Replaced direct model updates with a double-entry ledger system using the `leave_ledger_entries` table. Configured pessimistic locking (`lockForUpdate()`) and database transactions (`DB::transaction()`) during approvals, cancellations, and overrides. Built commands to backfill opening balances and execute monthly accruals.
* **Current Implementation:** Balance alterations (deductions, refunds, accruals, adjustments) are transactionally written to the ledger database. Approvals retrieve user rows using pessimistic locks to block concurrent writes.

### Codebase Mappings
* **Controllers:**
  * [LeaveRequestController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/LeaveRequestController.php) (applies pessimistic locks and transaction wrappers during approvals/cancellations)
* **Models:**
  * [LeaveLedgerEntry.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/LeaveLedgerEntry.php) (ledger table log model)
  * [User.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/User.php) (tracks `leave_balance` column)
* **Services:**
  * [LeaveBalanceService.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Services/LeaveBalanceService.php) (initializes employee on creation)
* **Console Commands:**
  * [InitializeBalancesCommand.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Console/Commands/InitializeBalancesCommand.php) (`leaves:initialize-balances`)
  * [AccrueLeavesCommand.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Console/Commands/AccrueLeavesCommand.php) (`leaves:accrue`)
* **Migrations:**
  * `2026_06_23_000000_add_leave_balance_and_ledger_tables.php` (adds `leave_balance` column to `users` and creates `leave_ledger_entries` table)
* **Feature Tests:**
  * [LeaveBalanceTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/LeaveBalanceTest.php) (checks balance initialization, monthly credits accrual, paid leave deductions, refunds, and admin override balance corrections)
* **Release Introduced:** `v1.1-phase-4.5`
* **Current Operational Status:** Fully operational. Accrual commands check for entries within the current month to prevent duplicate credits (idempotent validation).

## 7. Zimyo Excel Import Engine

### Business Purpose
To execute bulk migrations of workforce directories from external platform exports (specifically Zimyo spreadsheets), auto-create missing departments, map supervisor hierarchies without order-of-insertion limitations, configure opening leave balances, and record processing logs.

### Architecture Lineage
* **Original Business Problem:** Migrating personnel lists from external providers took hours. Attempting to link reporting managers failed in a standard single-pass import script because supervisors were often defined on rows further down the sheet, meaning their User accounts did not exist yet.
* **Phase Introduced:** Phase 4.1 (Zimyo Migration Engine) and Phase 4 (Uploader logs).
* **Major Evolutions:**
  * *Phase 4.1 (Commit `d88009b`):* Created `EmployeeImportService.php` with a two-pass parser. Pass 1 imports users, profiles, and initial ledger credits. Pass 2 runs manager-employee hierarchical linking using in-memory ID maps.
  * *Phase 4 (Commit `3369d64`):* Integrated uploader error reporting by storing run statistics and warning listings in the `import_logs` table.
* **Current Implementation:** Excel spreadsheets are uploaded by Admins and parsed via `PhpSpreadsheet`. The service processes the sheets inside a database transaction, standardizing ID strings, validating statuses, and logging warning JSON payloads.

### Codebase Mappings
* **Controllers:**
  * [ImportController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/ImportController.php) (manages file upload posts and displays status summaries)
* **Models:**
  * [ImportLog.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/ImportLog.php) (logs processing stats and warnings)
* **Services:**
  * [EmployeeImportService.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Services/EmployeeImportService.php) (two-pass Excel uploader logic)
* **Routes:**
  * `admin.import.show` / `admin.import.handle` (admin restricted)
* **Views:**
  * `resources/views/admin/import-employees.blade.php`
* **Migrations:**
  * `2026_06_18_193234_create_import_logs_table.php` (import logs)
* **Feature Tests:**
  * [ImportEmployeesTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/ImportEmployeesTest.php) (asserts uploader role access, formats validation, manager mappings, and error logging)
* **Release Introduced:** `v1.1-phase-4.1`
* **Current Operational Status:** Fully operational. Standardizes employee IDs using prefix formatting (e.g. converts raw values like `"10"` or `"EMP10"` to sequential `"EMP00010"`).
