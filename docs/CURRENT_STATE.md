## 2. Active Application Modules

### 1. Authentication & Security
* Laravel Breeze session-based authentication.
* Custom middleware checks ensuring new or password-reset employees are blocked and redirected to the `/password-change` route on login.
* Model-level encryption casts for sensitive financial and governmental fields (`aadhar_card`, `pan`, `account_no`, `ifsc_code`).

### 2. Department & Employee Directory
* Department CRUD interface with unique codes and descriptions.
* Extended personnel profile tabs with personal, contact, address, bank, education, and previous employment sections.
* Automated unique employee ID generator.

### 3. Attendance Tracking & Auditing
* Interactive dashboard check-in and check-out tracking buttons.
* Automated delay minute calculations (shift start 09:00 with a 15-minute grace period under old rules, or 09:30 with 15-minute grace under new rules).
* Weekend skips (Sundays are flagged as `weekend`, Saturdays are processed as workdays).
* Approved leaves and WFH integrations (approved requests set daily status to `on_leave` or `wfh` automatically; physical check-ins override leave).
* **Punctuality Audit Center:** Date, department, status, and search filters for check-in logs, alongside late arrivals and delay averages.

### 4. Leave Management & Balance Ledger
* Planned, Unplanned, and Birthday Leave categories (replaces legacy Paid/Unpaid selections).
* Approval status is the sole determinant of compensation outcome. Approved leaves deduct balance and protect salary (marked as `on_leave`). Rejected or cancelled leaves with no check-in default to `absent` (salary deducted). Physical check-ins override leave request statuses.
* **Reusable Leave Credit Engine:** Extensible ledger supporting allocation, tracking, consumption, and expiration of special leave credits (like Birthday Leave).
* **Birthday Leave Credits Sync:** Dynamic credits syncer unlocking birthday leave on Birthday - 1 day, automatically expiring unused credits on Birthday + 12 months, and supporting leap year (Feb 29) birthday fallbacks to Feb 28.
* Transaction audit ledger (`leave_ledger_entries` records all adjustments: opening balances, accruals, deductions, refunds).
* Concurrency checks via `lockForUpdate()` database row-level locking on user tables and leave credits.

### 5. Zimyo Migration Engine
* Bulk Excel file importer using `PhpSpreadsheet` library.
* Auto-creates missing departments and maps reporting managers using in-memory lookups.
* Auto-assigns temporary passwords and sets the password update requirement.

### 6. Profile Correction Requests
* Employee profile modification request forms.
* Admin review queue and update resolution dashboard.
* Sidebar red count badge displaying pending requests.
