## 3. Subsystem Lineage Chronicle

### Phase B — Stitch Sidebar Redesign
* **Business Problem:** Scattered navigation links in header, lacking mobile responsiveness.
* **Details:** Built a responsive sticky left navigation panel containing role-based menu options.
* **Files:** `sidebar.blade.php` [NEW], `app.blade.php` [MODIFY].

### Phase C — Attendance Tracking Foundation
* **Business Problem:** Lacked centralized login trackers and delays math.
* **Details:** Created daily check-ins logging table, clock endpoints, delay duration calculations (shift start 09:00 with 15m grace), and personal history logs.
* **Files:** `2026_06_10_000000_create_attendances_table.php` [NEW], [AttendanceController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/AttendanceController.php) [NEW], [AttendanceService.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Services/AttendanceService.php) [NEW].

### Phase C.1 — Employee and Department CRUD
* **Business Problem:** Admin could not configure departments or register workforce users.
* **Details:** Added Department model CRUD, directory listing tables, status checks (`active`/`inactive`), and auto-generated unique employee IDs.
* **Files:** [DepartmentController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/DepartmentController.php) [NEW], [EmployeeController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php) [NEW].

### Phase D — Hierarchy & Workforce Management
* **Business Problem:** Managers could view staff lists of unrelated departments, violating data security boundaries.
* **Details:** Integrated manager hierarchy controls restricting queries to direct reports.
* **Files:** `2026_06_11_134500_add_admin_id_to_users_table.php` [NEW], [DashboardController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php) [NEW].

### Phase E — Leave Requests & Rule B Override
* **Business Problem:** Staff on approved leaves were marked absent due to empty logs.
* **Details:** Developed leave request status chains, manager review controls, and Rule B approved leaves overriding absent flags.
* **Files:** `2026_06_11_153000_create_leave_requests_table.php` [NEW], [LeaveRequest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/LeaveRequest.php) [NEW], [LeaveRequestController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/LeaveRequestController.php) [NEW].

### Phase 4 — Profiles & Encrypted Fields
* **Business Problem:** Storing identifiers (Aadhaar, PAN, Bank Details) in plain text violated data compliance.
* **Details:** Isolated personal metadata inside `employee_profiles` and casted fields using AES-256 models encryption.
* **Files:** `2026_06_18_093324_create_employee_profiles_table.php` [NEW], [EmployeeProfile.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/EmployeeProfile.php) [NEW].

### Phase 4.1 — Zimyo Migration Engine
* **Business Problem:** Manual migration of personnel lists from Zimyo sheets was slow and mapping manager loops failed if subordinate rows preceded manager rows.
* **Details:** Created Excel upload parser executing in two passes to link managers, write encrypted personal records, and generate logs.
* **Files:** `2026_06_18_193234_create_import_logs_table.php` [NEW], [EmployeeImportService.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Services/EmployeeImportService.php) [NEW].

### Phase 4.2 — Correction Requests & Hardening
* **Business Problem:** Employees required a way to update errors in profile details without direct edit credentials.
* **Details:** Built correction requests submission form, admin control queue, and transaction processing.
* **Files:** `2026_06_19_090000_create_profile_correction_requests_table.php` [NEW], [ProfileCorrectionRequestController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/ProfileCorrectionRequestController.php) [NEW].

### Phase 4.3 — Experience Column Corrections
* **Business Problem:** Experience fields cast as decimals failed to import text duration strings (e.g. "5 Years 2 Months").
* **Details:** Migrated columns to nullable strings in database.
* **Files:** `2026_06_19_084725_change_experience_columns_to_strings_in_employee_profiles.php` [NEW].

### Phase 4.4 — Punctuality Audit Center
* **Business Problem:** Admins lacked a search-filtered audit view to monitor check-ins, exceptions, and delay metrics.
* **Details:** Created scrollable audit log grid, search filters, late exception listings, and delay average stats.
* **Files:** [AttendanceAuditController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/AttendanceAuditController.php) [NEW], `admin/attendance-logs.blade.php` [NEW].

### Phase 4.5 — Leave Balance Ledger & Concurrency
* **Business Problem:** Editing leave balances directly lacked change logs and concurrent clicks caused duplicate deductions.
* **Details:** Created double-entry ledger audits, console accruals scheduler, and pessimistic row locking (`lockForUpdate`).
* **Files:** `2026_06_23_000000_add_leave_balance_and_ledger_tables.php` [NEW], [LeaveLedgerEntry.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/LeaveLedgerEntry.php) [NEW], [AccrueLeavesCommand.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Console/Commands/AccrueLeavesCommand.php) [NEW].

### Phase 4.6 — Leave Workflow Simplification & Badge Alerts
* **Business Problem:** Staff self-classifying leaves caused errors. Admins lacked sidebar indicators for pending correction requests.
* **Details:** Made `leave_type` nullable in submissions; employees submit dates/reasons only. Managers select Paid/Unpaid on approval. Added sidebar count alert badge.
* **Files:** `2026_06_23_184204_make_leave_type_nullable_in_leave_requests_table.php` [NEW], [LeaveRequestController.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Http/Controllers/LeaveRequestController.php) [MODIFY], [sidebar.blade.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/resources/views/components/sidebar.blade.php) [MODIFY].

### Phase 4.7 — Architecture Traceability & Consolidation
* **Business Problem:** Fragile documentation, unmapped database configurations, and missing tag checkpoints.
* **Details:** Executed database, codebase, and security audit, established feature/database/test maps and decision logs.
* **Files:** `FEATURE_MAP.md` [NEW], `DATABASE_MAP.md` [NEW], `DECISION_LOG.md` [NEW], `RELEASE_MAP.md` [NEW].

### Phase 4.7.2 — Leave Authorization System & Credits Engine
* **Business Problem:** Leaves lacked automated controls for special credits (e.g. Birthday Leaves) and attendance lacked a payroll source of truth.
* **Details:** Removed Paid/Unpaid workflow in requests, replacing them with Planned, Unplanned, and Birthday Leave categories. Setup approval-driven attendance resolution (`on_leave` vs `absent`). Built a reusable `leave_credits` engine for birthday credits sync and expirations.
* **Files:** `2026_06_24_154000_create_leave_credits_table.php` [NEW], [LeaveCredit.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/app/Models/LeaveCredit.php) [NEW], [LeaveAuthorizationModelTest.php](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/AMS-V1/tests/Feature/LeaveAuthorizationModelTest.php) [NEW].

### Phase 4.7.3 — Readability & Usability Pass
* **Business Problem:** Spacing density, low-contrast tags, and light-mode remnants in inputs and profiles.
* **Details:** Standardized cell padding (`py-3.5 px-5`), row hovers (`bg-brass/[0.04]`), and desaturated tag styles. Re-skinned Breeze forms to dark-theme panel components.
* **Files:** `resources/css/app.css` [MODIFY], `tailwind.config.js` [MODIFY], `employees/create.blade.php` [MODIFY], `profile/edit.blade.php` [MODIFY].
